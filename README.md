# Java-O.O.P-& DSA with-N.E.I.U
Welcome to my O.O.P and DSA repository! As a proud student of Northeastern Illinois College, I've had the privilege of completing courses in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) during the Fall 2023 semester.

These courses have provided me with a solid foundation in the core principles of computer science, specifically focusing on the four pillars of OOP:

#### Abstraction
#### Polymorphism
#### Inheritance
#### Encapsulation

Additionally, in DSA, we explored various data structures, from ArrayLists to Queues and Stacks, delving into their implementations and applications.

### About This Repository

This repository is a collection of selected assignments and solutions that I've worked on throughout the OOP and DSA courses. It serves as a reflection of the knowledge and skills I've gained during this period. While the current repository contains a number of assignments from Fall 2023, I am continuously searching for more to add.

### Future Endeavors
I am excited to announce that I have started a new journey of revisiting OOP and DSA concepts with guidance from Kunal Kushwaha. This new adventure is documented in a separate repository where I will be posting new assignments, solutions, and insights. It's a journey of reinforcing my understanding and diving deeper into these fundamental concepts.

### Contributions
Feel free to explore this repository and the projects within. Your feedback, suggestions, and contributions are highly welcome. Whether you're a fellow student, an educator, or just someone interested in computer science, your insights are valuable to me.
